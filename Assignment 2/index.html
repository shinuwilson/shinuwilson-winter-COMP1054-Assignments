        <!-- First stanza of the song -->
            <p>
                Heart beats fast<br>
                Colors and promises<br>
                How to be brave?<br>
                How can I love when I'm afraid to fall?<br>
                But watching you stand alone<br>
                All of my doubt suddenly goes away somehow
            </p>

            <p>One step closer</p>
        <!-- Second stanza of the song -->
        <p>
            I have died every day waiting for you<br>
            Darling, don't be afraid<br>
            I have loved you for a thousand years<br>
            I'll love you for a thousand more
        </p>
        <!-- Third stanza of the song -->
        <p>
            Time stands still<br>
            Beauty in all she is<br>
            I will be brave<br>
            I will not let anything take away<br>
            What's standing in front of me<br>
            Every breath, every hour has come to this
        </p>
        <!-- Repetition of the transition part -->
        <p>One step closer</p>
        <!-- Repeating the second stanza -->
        <p>
            I have died every day waiting for you<br>
            Darling, don't be afraid<br>
            I have loved you for a thousand years<br>
            I'll love you for a thousand more
        </p>
        <!-- Fourth stanza of the song -->
        <p>
            And all along I believed I would find you<br>
            Time has brought your heart to me<br>
            I have loved you for a thousand years<br>
            I'll love you for a thousand more
        </p>

            I have died every day waiting for you<br>
            Darling, don't be afraid<br>
            I have loved you for a thousand years<br>
            I'll love you for a thousand more
        </p>
